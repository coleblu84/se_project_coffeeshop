# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. At the sametime showing new ways of organizing the .CSS files. Which I find very helpful.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- build on when to use Div tags over H1, H2, & H3 over P tags.
- how to properly use hover and transitions. Without having to watch the video.
- best understand animation and how to use it.
- get a better understanding of @keyframes.
- keep working on feeling comfortable on building the HTML
